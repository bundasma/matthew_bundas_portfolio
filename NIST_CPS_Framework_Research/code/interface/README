At the moment, the three files that make up the interface are OntologyGUI.py, owlNode.py, and owlOntology.py.
The rest of the files are outdated an no longer used. I am using a few packages whose versions required are
specific to your python version, so it is difficult to say exactly which packages you will need to install to run the program.
To run the program execute OntologyGUI.py

The program however requires:
  numpy
  matplotlib
  networkx
  graphviz
  pygraphviz
  owlready2
  pydotplus

The difficulty is getting graphviz, pygraphviz and pydotplus all to be happy with eachother.
I'd recommend using whichever methods you usually use to install packages to get these
and note that if you are using anaconda, an easy way to install these packages is:

  conda install -c alubbock graphviz pygraphviz

However, it doesn't seem perfect for everyone

You also may get the error "dot not recognized", which can be fixed using "dot -c" in terminal

I hope to either find a solution for installing these packages easily, or restructure the
program so it doesn't require these packages at all.
