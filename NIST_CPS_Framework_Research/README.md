## National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cyber-physical System Framework

As part of this project, I performed a variety of work surrounding the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Cyber-physical System (CPS) Framework. The CPS Framework is a knowledge representation and reasoning approach to modeling and constraining a CPS's abilities, shortcomings and behavior. At its core is a tree-like, heiarchial knowledge structure called an ontology. In this tree structure, each node is a concern stakeholders care about relating to a CPS. At the highest level of the ontology are the broadest concerns, called aspects and include things like Trustworthiness, Business, Data, Human etc. Below these aspects are series of concerns, which in turn can have sub-concerns creating a tree with depth ranging from 2-6 depending on the branch. Properties or requirements the CPS takes on help to address these concerns, leading to a concern's satisfaction or dissastisfaction. In general, for a concern to be satisfied all of its recursive sub-concerns must also be satisfied. For example, in order for the Security concern to be satisfied, its subconcerns Cybersecurity and Physicalsecurit must be satified, which also have their own subconcerns.
