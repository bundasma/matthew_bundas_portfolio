## Simulating Enhanced C12+C12 Reaction Rates in Massive Stars During Carbon Shell Burning

As part of this project, I conducted astrophysical simulations to explore newly theorized reaction rates for a specific fusion reaction occuring in stars. 

For an overview of the project, check out the poster I created. For a more detailed look check out my paper or presentation I made as part of my senior thesis.

My favorite result of the project is a movie visualizing the simulation showing the velocity of material in roughly the inner third of the star. On the left is the simulation using the old/traditional C12/C12 fusion reaction rate, and on the right is the enhanced newly theorized reaction rates. It does a nice job showing the increased energy production due to more C12/C12 fusion. To construct this movie, I created a series of images at interval time steps using log files and python, and stiched them together using FFmpeg: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dik8lKlVvJzZRvcd24woERJ2HwcVFAui/view?usp=sharing

**Abstract:**
A major factor in the dynamics of stars as they pass through burning stages is how easily a given fusion reaction takes place, which is directly tied to the reaction rate. Reaction rates directly affect the composition and structure of a star which in turn affects other processes in the star. Reaction rates and in particular the Carbon-12 + Carbon-12 (C12-C12) rate are not easily measured in a laboratory setting, leading to dispute in their values. A recent paper from A. Tumino et. al experimentally found using the Trojan Horse Method (THM), underlying resonances in the C12-C12 to Mg 24 reaction rate, leading to a much enhanced rate compared to the standard Caughlan-Fowler 88 (CF88) rate. To test the potential effects of the newly found THM rate we ran two 20,000s 2-D simulations of a 25 solar mass star undergoing carbon shell burning using the hydrodynamical astrophysical code FLASH, one implementing the CF88 C12-C12 rate and one implementing the THM rate. I examine the increase in nuclear energy production, increase in strength of convection, and change in element abundance within the star.
