## Class Projects

Throughout my studies at MSU and NMSU, I completed many group and invididual projects. I've included a handful of notable projects, which I've managed to hold on to in one way or another. 


### Computational Physics - Random number generation methods
I tested 4 methods of producing random numbers and explored their effectiveness. Each method was evaluated using quantitative metrics and qualitative graphs.

### Computational Statistics - NFL rushing play exploration with linear models
Created linear models using R to explore what factors impact a rushing play and in what manner.

### Database Management - Benchmarking and presentation on SQLite
With a partner, I collected information about SQLite, comparing its uses and features to MySQL. We also performed experiments to directly compare the speed of SQLite and MySQL with and without indexes.

### Deep Learning - Astronomical object classification using deep neural networks
Based on a Kaggle project, I created a deep neural network with largely engineered input features to classify astronomical objects using simulated data based on a soon to be opened survey observatory.
