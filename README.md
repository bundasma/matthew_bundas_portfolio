My name is Matthew Bundas, I recently finished up my Master's Degree in Computer Science at New Mexico State University in late 2021 after obtaining a Bachelor's in Astrophysics from Michigan State University in 2019. During my time in college, I primarily worked as a Research Assistant where I contributed to a range of projects. Below is a peak at some of my projects, with more thorough details and code for each project in their own directories. I have also included my general resume in this repository.




## Deep/Machine Learning - NASA GLOBE Observer
Developed a novel deep learning framework to classify content of citizen-submitted images for one of NASA's global landcover programs, GLOBE Observer. My solutions outperformed citizen classification by a significant margin.

## Astrophysical Simulations with FLASH
Conducted and analyzed astrophysical simulations of high-mass stars to explore the potential impacts of varying fusion reaction rates. I used the open source code, FLASH and MSU's High Performance Computing Center to run them and python to investigate and visualize them in post. This work contributed to my senior thesis.

## National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber-physical System (CPS) Framework
Worked on various projects surrounding NIST's CPS Framework, including creating my own application and incorporating AI into the CPS Framework. My group and I published four papers and completed two tutorials.

## Michigan State University Observatory
End-to-End operation of MSU's campus observatory, including telesope operation and data reduction. Over the course of more than two years, I completed 1,000+ observations, and was promoted to a position where I trained my peers.

## Class Projects
Deep learning classification of astronomical objects, random number generation, computational statistics regarding American football rushing plays and SQLite performance testing among many others.
