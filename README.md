My name is Matthew Bundas, I recently finished up my Master's Degree in Computer Science at New Mexico State University in late 2021 after obtaining a Bachelor's in Astrophysics from Michigan State University in 2019. During my time in college, I primarily worked as a Research Assistant where I contributed to a range of projects. Below is a peak at some of my projects, with more thorough details and code for each project in their own directories.




## NASA GLOBE Observer Deep Learning
Developed a novel deep learning framework to classify content of citizen-submitted images for one of NASA's global landcover programs, GLOBE Observer.

## Astrophysical Simulations
Ran and analyzed astrophysical simulations of high-mass stars to explore the potential impacts of varying fusion reaction rates.

## National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber-physical System (CPS) Framework
Worked on various projects surrounding NIST's CPS Framework, including creating my own application and incorporating AI into the CPS Framework.
