    "## Notebook for manually labeling during a SSAL experiment\n",

    "Allows a user to specify the desired database and retrieves that database's active learning table (data needing labels from an oracle). It then loops through all of the active learning selections, looking to see if a label already exists in the master labeling csv, if it does, it uses that label and moves to the next image. If a label is not in the master csv, it flashes the image on the screen and gets input regarding the label. When all images have a label, the newly aquired labels are saved to the master csv, and the database gets updated. Upon finishing, the active learning table should be cleared out and empty."
