## GLOBE Observer Landcover Content Classification

The GLOBE Observer program is a NASA-sponsored citizen science project helping to understand the state and evolution of Earth's landcover content, where landcover content is essentially what is found at Earth's surface at a given location such as forest, open water, urban etc. The program allows users to, via a smartphone application, take pictures of their surroundings and identify the content of those pictures. It's an incredibly powerful strategy to obtaining mass amounts of data, as data collection isn't just limited to scientists and everyone can get involved. However, it also poses challenges when it comes to the quality of the data. In the application, providing descriptions of the land is optional, leading to many participants skipping out on that part and just uploading images. These images are still valuable, but not quite as valuable as if they had labels. This is the main motivation of the work I performed - to find a machine learning solution to essentially label unlabeled images as part of the GLOBE dataset. This problem is easy enough given the computer vision methodologies existing today, however the quality of the GLOBE dataset made it quite a challenging task. The dataset is extremely unbalanced in terms of its classes, with the most dominant class, urban, making up about 30% of the images, and others makng up as few as 1% of images. Additionally image desciriptions provided by citizens were incorrect on average about 35% of the time, introducing major label noise. Many images themselves, whether labeled or not, were also of poor quality. Images of the sky, the ground, people's thumbs etc. were common occurences. These individual problems all introduce extra challenges to training a machine learning model, but the challenge only becomes greater when they are all present.,
