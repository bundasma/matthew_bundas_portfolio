## GLOBE Observer Landcover Content Classification

The GLOBE Observer program is a NASA-sponsored citizen science project helping to understand the state and evolution of Earth's landcover content. Data is collected by ordinary people via a mobile application, where users take pictures of their surroundings and have the **option** to provide descriptions of those images, helping to build landcover content maps for scientists to use. My work's goal was to find a machine learning solution to provide labels to un-described images to increase the usefullness of the GLOBE dataset. The dataset however has many issues posing challenges to training a machine learning model, including class imbalance, label noise and poor image quality. I developed a novel framework to help overcome these issues, obtaining a machine learning model which outperforms manual citizen labeling.
